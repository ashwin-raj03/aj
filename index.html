<p style="font-size:22px">
You could argue Eric Dier was at fault for Ronaldo's first goal of the night - you cannot allow any player that much space to shoot from distance, let alone if that player is Cristiano Ronaldo.

But as much as Spurs will analyse it and look at how poor they were defensively, you still need incredible skill and technique to be able to do what he did and find the top corner from there.<br>
<br>His second goal was nowhere near as spectacular but you can bet it gave him just as much satisfaction. I enjoyed scoring from three yards just as much as I did from 30.</p>
<p style="font-size:22px">
His third goal was my favourite, though - Ronaldo had to get every part of it right, and he did.
From the way he reads the flight of the cross to the way he attacks it and times his jump, then meets the ball with accuracy and power, it was all absolutely perfect - a textbook header.<br>
In those situations it is always one versus one - attacker against defender, and you've got to be stronger than everyone else. Ronaldo had to get away from his marker, Cristian Romero, who is trying to hang on to him, then had to read the cross and get the contact right to guide it in as Matt Doherty put him under pressure.<br>
To do all that within about two seconds as the ball comes over is not easy, but he made it look that way.
